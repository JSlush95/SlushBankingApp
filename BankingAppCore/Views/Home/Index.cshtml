            This website is a mockup program that emulates bank account management. It uses C# .NET 8, ASP.Net Core Identity and Entity Framework, with Razor HTML and Bootstrap.<br />
            As proof that I can make something more than just a simple program, I aimed to create a two-tiered system with real world applications. It is done with a combination of banking and storefront websites.

                Please enjoy, this system may be a bit flawed, as I am still new to this. This will act as the payment methods for the companion mockup storefront website.

            I am a graduate from Arizona State University under the IRA Fulton Schools of Engineering. I decided to make a banking website to showcase the skills I have learned.<br />
            This is a companion website to my other companion <a href="https://slushstore20240729193313.azurewebsites.net/Home/About">storefront website</a>.
